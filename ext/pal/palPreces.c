*  Name:
*     palPreces

*  Purpose:
*     Precession - either FK4 or FK5 as required.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     void palPreces ( const char sys[3], double ep0, double ep1,
*                      double *ra, double *dc );

*  Arguments:
*     sys = const char [3] (Given)
*        Precession to be applied: FK4 or FK5. Case insensitive.
*     ep0 = double (Given)
*        Starting epoch.
*     ep1 = double (Given)
*        Ending epoch
*     ra = double * (Given & Returned)
*        On input the RA mean equator & equinox at epoch ep0. On exit
*        the RA mean equator & equinox of epoch ep1.
*     dec = double * (Given & Returned)
*        On input the dec mean equator & equinox at epoch ep0. On exit
*        the dec mean equator & equinox of epoch ep1.

*  Description:
*     Precess coordinates using the appropriate system and epochs.

*  Authors:
*     PTW: Patrick T. Wallace
*     TIMJ: Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  Notes:
*     - Uses palPrec for FK5 data and palPrebn for FK4 data.
*     - The epochs are Besselian if SYSTEM='FK4' and Julian if 'FK5'.
*        For example, to precess coordinates in the old system from
*        equinox 1900.0 to 1950.0 the call would be:
*             palPreces( "FK4", 1900.0, 1950.0, &ra, &dc );
*     - This routine will NOT correctly convert between the old and
*       the new systems - for example conversion from B1950 to J2000.
*       For these purposes see palFk425, palFk524, palFk45z and
*       palFk54z.
*     - If an invalid SYSTEM is supplied, values of -99D0,-99D0 will
*       be returned for both RA and DC.

*  History:
*     2012-03-02 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version
*        Adapted with permission from the Fortran SLALIB library.
